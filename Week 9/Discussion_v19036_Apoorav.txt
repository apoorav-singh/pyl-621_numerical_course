Discussion on the accuracy of the Simpson's (1/3) rule over Trapezoidal rule.

It is evident from the data obtained from the code that Integration is gets more precise as we decresase the step size but it 
also depends upon the method used.

As evident Simpson's (1/3) rule is more precise as well asmore accurate in its calculation because Trapezoidal rule simply breaks the
curve in linear fashion whereas Simpson's (1/3) rule does the same thing in quadratic manner which provides a better fit for curved 
figures as in the case of QLHO wave-function.
